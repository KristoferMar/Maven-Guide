# Maven profiles
A profile in maven is a set of configurations and settings that can be activated or deactivated based on certain conditions or criteria. A profile allows you to customize the build process based on different environments, such as development, testing or production.

Profiles are defined in the "pom.xml" file and can be activated or deactivated by passing command-line arguments to the Maven process, or by using Maven's activation mechanisms. 

This is an example of a defined profile in a pom.xml file.

```
<profiles>
  <profile>
    <id>development</id>
    <activation>
      <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <properties>
      <db.url>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb_dev</db.url>
      <db.username>dev_user</db.username>
      <db.password>dev_password</db.password>
    </properties>
  </profile>
  <profile>
    <id>production</id>
    <activation>
      <property>
        <name>env</name>
        <value>prod</value>
      </property>
    </activation>
    <properties>
      <db.url>jdbc:mysql://prodserver:3306/mydb_prod</db.url>
      <db.username>prod_user</db.username>
      <db.password>prod_password</db.password>
    </properties>
  </profile>
</profiles>
```

In this profile you find both "development and production. The development profile is activated by default, and the production profile is activated only when the env property is set to prod.
